# 7.2 Hex Mex

The goal of this assignment was to create a single page site that loaded the html document, then build and render the actual page content using vanilla JavaScript and AJAX.

Specifically we were looking to minimize the page load time in this project and explored various techniques to do so. We were also looking to work on our DOM traversal skills.

Last but not least, I used Sass to style the assignment in order to build my experience with it.
